# Xylophone ðŸŽ¹

## Our Goal

In this app we try using the audioplayers plugin to make an app that emulates the working of a xylophone. A xylophone is a musical instrument that plays the do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do pattern.

Weâ€™re going to make a music app that plays Xylophone sounds. For every Beethoven out there, this will let you unleash your musical talent where ever you are.
